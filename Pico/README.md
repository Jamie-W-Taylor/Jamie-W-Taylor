# Cupboard Monitor

## Why?

People keep stealing my food! This is a little Pico project to let me know when my cupboard door has been opened and closed.

It writes to a log file on the Pico so that I can review it later.

Thrn blame someone!

## How?

It uses a Pico with MicoPython, just because its really easy to work with.

The hardware setup is taken from here:

The software is in this GitHUb

## Future Work

I really like the idea of using a Pico camera to get a snap of the thief!
