# Python Analysis Example

 

This is an example data analysis project to try out different Python data analysis tooling and patterns.

 

## Why?

 

I am a big F1 fan and so I am going to skew this example to use as much F1 data as I can get my hands on. I want to see if I can extract any useful correlation data that you don't find on the F1 mobile applications.

 

## How?

 

Going to use Python because of the wide number of data analysis libraries available. I also want to learn more about it and this seems like a good opportunity.

 

If you know of any good open source F1 data available please let me know! I won't get very far without the data :-)

 

I am going to follow this general process, the ordering is a little different to what you would normally do - requirements would usually be done first so you know what you are doing! But I am going to determine the data first, because the data is going to be hard to find and given what I can get hold of will determine what's possible.

 

- **Data Gathering**

Internet searching and emailing the F1 teams, to see what data is openly available.

 

- **Requirements Gathering**

Based on the data available I will then be able to see what is possible.

 

- **Analysis Tooling Development**

Start the analysis development using Python and as many open source libraries as I can (no point reinventing the world)

 

- **Testing and Feedback**

I will be iteratively developing and testing as I go along and refining and refactoring as I gain feedback and more knowledge.

 

## When?

 

I am working on this whilst doing my 2nd university software engineering course, so expect developments throughout 2022/2023
